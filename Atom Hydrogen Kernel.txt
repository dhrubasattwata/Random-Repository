For Python
in CMD
python -m pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user

For R

If Anaconda is installed and the Jupyter-Notebook with it (should be the standard install), open up the Anaconda prompt, 
not the Windows command prompt or the Anaconda Navigator
Look up the executable of R (not Rgui or Rstudio), it should be somewhere like 
C:\Program Files\R\R-3.6.3\bin and remember the path typing cd C:\Program Files\R\R-3.5.1\bin and 
start R by typing R
install.packages('IRkernel')
typing IRkernel::installspec()
Now you can start an R kernel within Jupyter-Notebook


For Julia

type "julia" to start julia repl
I had to enter '']" to get the "pkg>" prompt.
then enter add "IJulia"
then I could restart my jupyter notebook and julia worked
